          p The year is 5013.  You are the pilot of a guard ship, designed to
            | protect the space station Zurb against unwary space pirates.
            | Scientists at Zurb were researching a way to create wormholes to
            | other dimensions, when an accident ocurred:  the space station
            | exploded, and created wormholes to nearly-identical alternate
            | realities, where alternate versions of yourself exist.

          p The trouble is, the existence of the wormholes is pulling apart the
            | fabric of spacetime. They are being kept open with quantum bonds
            | between your ship and the ships in the alternate dimensions. The
            | only way to close the wormholes is to destroy the other ships. But
            | they know that too...

          p The ships cannot travel through the wormholes; they are too massive.
            | But your ammunition is merely energy, so you can fire bullets into
            | the other dimensions in the hope that your alternate selves will 
            | run into them.

          h2 Controls
          p Turn your ship with left/right arrow keys. Move forward by thrusting
            | with the up arrow key. As you thrust, you use up your fuel, but you
            | regenerate more when you are not accelerating. Press space to fire.
            | If you would like to sacrifice yourself for the better of the
            | universe, press q.

          h2 tl;dr
          p Click "play" to start a game.  Once enough players have joined, the
            | game will start. Shoot into your opponents' wormholes to kill them.
